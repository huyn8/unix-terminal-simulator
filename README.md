# unix-terminal-simulator

### This project consists of designing a C/C++ program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. The implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. This project involves using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and can be completed run on any Linux, UNIX, or macOS system.
